# docs/

Project context and planning documents for humans and AI agents.

- **Start here:** [AI_ROOT_CONTEXT.md](AI_ROOT_CONTEXT.md) – project overview, layout, deployment.
- **Pattern we use:** [AGENTIC-CONTEXT-GIT-PATTERN.md](AGENTIC-CONTEXT-GIT-PATTERN.md) – how we commit context/planning with feature work.
- **Feature/area docs:** Add planning, end-state, or migration docs here (e.g. `SHOP-EXPERIENCE-END-STATE.md`, `INFRA-NAMESPACE-MIGRATION.md`) and commit them on the same branch as the implementation.

Root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) points agents at this folder.
